### Multi_Label_Classification_DistilBERT

The project aims to classify survey responses into multiple categories (labels). This is a multi-label classification problem, meaning each survey response can belong to multiple categories.
The model used is DistilBERT, a smaller and faster version of BERT, which has been pre-trained and is now being fine-tuned on a specific dataset.
